In our units of Kelvin and Angstrom (and defining :math:`\hbar=1`), the
appropriate value for He-4 is :math:`\lambda = 6.059615`.

If these units are unfamiliar to you, you should check this is the
correct value for :math:`\lambda=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}`.

| Starting with SI units, for example, we have
| :math:`\hbar=1.0545e-34~J\cdot s`
| :math:`m = 4 m_p = 6.68e-27~kg`
| which gives :math:`\lambda=8.32313e-43~J\cdot m^2`.

Inserting conversion factors of :math:`10^{10}\frac{\AA}{m}` and
:math:`1.38e-23~\frac{J}{K}`, we're left with
:math:`\lambda=6.059615~K\cdot\AA^2`.

Equivalently, in this system of units, the proton mass is
:math:`m_p = 0.0207~K^{-1}\AA^{-2}`.
