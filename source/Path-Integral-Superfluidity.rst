We have learned that in a Bosonic system, the paths are allowed to
permute onto each other, resulting in longger paths consisting of
multiple loops. In certain situations, we will find that the extent of
these loops is local: paths will permute with nearby paths only. On the
other hand, there will be situations where these paths form loops of
macroscopic size that extend across the entire box. It is when we are in
the latter regime that a system is said to be superfluid. Formally, we
define the winding number of the system. The winding number is the
number of paths that wrap around the box to the left minus the number of
paths that wrap around the box to the right. (Take note that having a
winding number goes beyond simply having winding paths. There must be a
net flux of paths in one direction). We can relate the superfluid
fraction :math:`\frac{\rho_s}{\rho}` with the average winding number
squared (times an appropriate constant)
:math:`\frac{\left<W^2\right>}{2\lambda\beta N}`.
