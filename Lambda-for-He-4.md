title: Lambda-for-He-4
---

In our units of Kelvin and Angstrom (and defining \\(\hbar=1\\)), the
appropriate value for He-4 is \\(\lambda = 6.059615\\).

If these units are unfamiliar to you, you should check this is the
correct value for \\(\lambda=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\\).

Starting with SI units, for example, we have\
 \\(\hbar=1.0545e-34~J\cdot s\\)\
 \\(m = 4 m\_p = 6.68e-27~kg\\)\
 which gives \\(\lambda=8.32313e-43~J\cdot m^2\\).

Inserting conversion factors of \\(10^{10}\frac{\AA}{m}\\) and
\\(1.38e-23~\frac{J}{K}\\), we're left with \\(\lambda=6.059615~K\cdot\AA^2\\).

Equivalently, in this system of units, the proton mass is
\\(m\_p = 0.0207~K^{-1}\AA^{-2}\\).
