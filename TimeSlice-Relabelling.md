title: TimeSlice-Relabelling
---

RelabelBeads relabels the particles in imaginary time going from the
first picture to the second one. This is done to ensure that we can
(without loss of generality) just move the "second slice" (slice 5 and
slice 3 respectively) and ensure that all time slices (colors) will
eventually get moved. Notice that if you move the "second" slice that
the length of the springs (lines) between the 1'st and 3'rd slice change
so you will need to compute the kinetic action on these.
